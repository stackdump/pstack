ICEBOX
------

- [ ] build address threshold/alerts

- [ ] use JWT auth + login with github
- [ ] create custom dashboard - can you source postgres from grafana


- [ ] add UI addresss/donate badges for github
      validate highest saved signed commit - as an estimate of trust

* Prototype Ideas

- [ ] IPFS DAG ipfs-ld based event prototcol?
- [ ] cloud-based Pub-Sub for frontend vs IPFS pub-sub?

- [ ] https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/json-format.md#31-handling-of-data
      support this standard? - mostly just seems like a wrapper - actual data is encoded
      reminds me of same relation in factomd entries w/ payload and refids
